/* // C uses integers internally to represent characters. Write a program that reads two letters and compares their 
integer equivalents. The program has to print the letters, their integer equivalents and the greater value.  For example, 
if the user types in A and b, the program should print: 

// The first character is Aand its integer equivalent is 65

// The second character is b and its integer equivalent is 98

// The integer equivalent of the second character b(98) is greater */
